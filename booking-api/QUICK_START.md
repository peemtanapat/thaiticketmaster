# Booking API - Quick Start

## 🚀 Getting Started (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.20+ installed
- PostgreSQL 12+ running
- Redis running
- Make installed (optional, but recommended)

### Step 0: Database Setup (Automatic!)

**Good news:** The application automatically creates the database and schema on startup!

```bash
# 1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
# 2. Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Update .env with your PostgreSQL credentials
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=5432
# DB_USER=postgres
# DB_PASSWORD=postgres
# DB_NAME=booking_db

# That's it! The app will create the database automatically.
```

See **[DATABASE_SETUP.md](./DATABASE_SETUP.md)** for complete details.

### Step 1: Run Tests (TDD Verification)

```bash
cd booking-api
make test
```

Expected output: **3 tests PASS**, 2 skipped ✅

### Step 2: Build the Application

```bash
make build
```

This creates `bin/booking-api` executable.

### Step 3: View Test Coverage

```bash
make test-coverage
```

Opens `coverage.html` showing 68.4% test coverage (15 tests).

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
make run
```

The application will:
1. ✅ Check if database exists
2. ✅ Create database if not exists
3. ✅ Create tables and indexes
4. ✅ Start the server on port 8081

Expected console output:
```
Checking database existence...
Database 'booking_db' does not exist. Creating...
Successfully created database 'booking_db'
Successfully connected to database
Creating/verifying database schema...
Successfully created/verified database schema
Starting booking-api server on port 8081
```

## 🧪 TDD Demonstration

### Red Phase (Tests Fail)
```bash
# Tests were written first - they initially failed
# See: internal/booking/booking_service_test.go
```

### Green Phase (Tests Pass)
```bash
# Minimal implementation added
# See: internal/booking/booking_service.go
make test  # All tests pass!
```

### Refactor Phase (Clean Code)
```bash
# Code improved with interfaces and better structure
# See: internal/booking/interfaces.go, event_client.go, etc.
make test  # Tests still pass!
```

**Coverage: 68.4%** 🎯

## 🎯 What Was Implemented (TDD)

### BookTickets Function Tests & Implementation:

1. ✅ **Distributed Lock Acquisition**
   - Redis-based locking
   - Interface: `Locker`
   - Implementation: `RedisLocker`

2. ✅ **Database Transaction Management**
   - PostgreSQL transactions
   - Interface: `TransactionManager`
   - Implementation: `SQLTransactionManager`

3. ✅ **Event API Integration**
   - HTTP client to event-api
   - Interface: `EventAPIClient`
   - Implementation: `HTTPEventAPIClient`
   - Validates: Event exists, Showtime matches

4. ✅ **Validation Rules**
   - Event existence
   - Showtime matching
   - Booking request validation

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
BookingService
    ↓
    ├── Locker (Redis)           → Distributed locking
    ├── TransactionManager (DB)   → ACID transactions
    └── EventAPIClient (HTTP)     → External API calls
```
