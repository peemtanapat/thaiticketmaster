# Migration Consolidation - Complete Summary

## 🎯 What Was Done

We consolidated **3 separate migration files** into **1 comprehensive migration** with the latest schema version.

### Before (v1.0 - Incremental Approach)
```
001_create_event_seats.sql          → Created event_seats (partial TIMESTAMPTZ)
002_add_event_seats_timestamps.sql  → Added reserved_at, reserved_until, sold_at
003_alter_showtime_timestamptz.sql  → Converted TIMESTAMP → TIMESTAMPTZ
```

**Issues with old approach:**
- ❌ Schema evolved across 3 files
- ❌ Inconsistent timestamp types (TIMESTAMP vs TIMESTAMPTZ)
- ❌ Required running 3 migrations sequentially
- ❌ Complex to understand final schema state
- ❌ Harder to maintain and deploy

### After (v2.0 - Consolidated Approach)
```
001_create_complete_schema.sql      → Everything in one place! ✨
```

**Benefits of new approach:**
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for complete schema
- ✅ **All timestamp columns use TIMESTAMPTZ** from the start
- ✅ Creates all 3 tables: bookings, booking_seats, event_seats
- ✅ Easier to understand and maintain
- ✅ Cleaner deployment process
- ✅ Better for new environments

## 📋 What's Included in the New Migration

### Part 1: Create `bookings` Table
```sql
- booking_id (unique identifier)
- event_id, user_id
- showtime TIMESTAMPTZ          ← Timezone-aware
- quantity, status
- created_at TIMESTAMPTZ        ← Timezone-aware
- updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ        ← Timezone-aware
```

### Part 2: Create `booking_seats` Table
```sql
- booking_id (foreign key)
- seat_id
- created_at TIMESTAMPTZ        ← Timezone-aware
```

### Part 3: Create `event_seats` Table
```sql
- event_id, showtime TIMESTAMPTZ    ← Timezone-aware
- seat_id, zone, row_number, seat_number
- price, status
- booking_id
- reserved_at TIMESTAMPTZ           ← Timezone-aware
- reserved_until TIMESTAMPTZ        ← Timezone-aware
- sold_at TIMESTAMPTZ               ← Timezone-aware
- created_at TIMESTAMPTZ            ← Timezone-aware
- updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ            ← Timezone-aware
```

### Part 4: Create Helper Functions
- `seats_exist_for_event()` - Check if seats are already created
- `create_seats_for_event()` - Automatically generate seats

### Part 5: Populate Sample Data
- Event 1 (Christmas Concert) - 20 seats
- Event 2 (New Year Concert) - 20 seats
- Total: 40 pre-populated seats

### Part 6: Verification
- Automatic table creation checks
- Seat count reporting
- Schema validation query

## 🔄 Changes from Old Migrations

### Timestamp Column Changes

| Table | Column | Old Type | New Type | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| bookings | showtime | TIMESTAMPTZ | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✅ Unchanged |
| bookings | created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✅ Unchanged |
| bookings | updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✅ Unchanged |
| booking_seats | created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✅ Unchanged |
| event_seats | showtime | TIMESTAMP → TIMESTAMPTZ | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✨ **Now consistent from start** |
| event_seats | reserved_at | Added in 002 | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✨ **Now in initial creation** |
| event_seats | reserved_until | Added in 002 | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✨ **Now in initial creation** |
| event_seats | sold_at | Added in 002 | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✨ **Now in initial creation** |
| event_seats | created_at | TIMESTAMP → TIMESTAMPTZ | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✨ **Now consistent from start** |
| event_seats | updated_at | TIMESTAMP → TIMESTAMPTZ | TIMESTAMPTZ | ✨ **Now consistent from start** |

### Index Changes

**New performance optimization:**
```sql
-- Composite index for faster availability checks
CREATE INDEX idx_event_seats_availability 
    ON event_seats(event_id, showtime, status, seat_id);
```

This index supports the optimized query pattern:
```sql
SELECT seat_id FROM event_seats 
WHERE event_id = ? AND showtime = ? AND seat_id = ANY(?)
```

---

## 📦 Old Files (Archived)

The following files have been renamed with `.old` extension and are kept for reference only:

```
001_create_event_seats.sql.old
002_add_event_seats_timestamps.sql.old
003_alter_showtime_timestamptz.sql.old
```

**These files are NOT required for new deployments.**

---

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### For New Environments (Fresh Database)

```bash
# Just run the consolidated migration
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d booking_db \
  -f migrations/001_create_complete_schema.sql
```

**That's it!** 🎉 One command creates everything.

### For Existing Environments (Already Has Old Migrations)

**Option A: Keep Existing Data (Recommended for Production)**

If you've already run migrations 001, 002, 003:
- ✅ Your schema is already correct
- ✅ No action needed
- ✅ The consolidated migration is for new deployments only

**Option B: Fresh Start (For Development/Testing)**

```bash
# 1. Backup data (if needed)
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres booking_db > backup.sql

# 2. Drop and recreate database
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres \
  -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS booking_db;"
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres \
  -c "CREATE DATABASE booking_db;"

# 3. Run consolidated migration
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d booking_db \
  -f migrations/001_create_complete_schema.sql

# 4. Restore data (if needed)
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d booking_db < backup.sql
```

## ✅ Verification

### Check All Tables Were Created

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('bookings', 'booking_seats', 'event_seats');
```

**Expected Output:**
```
 table_name    
---------------
 bookings
 booking_seats
 event_seats
```

### Verify TIMESTAMPTZ Columns

```sql
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('bookings', 'booking_seats', 'event_seats')
  AND column_name LIKE '%time%'
  OR column_name LIKE '%at'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
```

**Expected Output:** All should show `timestamp with time zone`

### Check Sample Data

```sql
SELECT 
    event_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_seats,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN zone = 'VIP' THEN 1 END) as vip_seats,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN zone = 'Premium' THEN 1 END) as premium_seats,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN zone = 'Standard' THEN 1 END) as standard_seats
FROM event_seats
GROUP BY event_id
ORDER BY event_id;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
 event_id | total_seats | vip_seats | premium_seats | standard_seats
----------+-------------+-----------+---------------+----------------
 event_1  |          20 |         5 |             5 |             10
 event_2  |          20 |         5 |             5 |             10
```

## 📝 Migration History

| Version | Date | Description | Files |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| v1.0 | Initial | Incremental migrations | 001, 002, 003 |
| v2.0 | 2025-10-07 | Consolidated single migration | 001_create_complete_schema.sql |

## 🔮 Future Migrations

When you need to add new features:

```
001_create_complete_schema.sql     ← Base schema (don't modify)
002_add_new_feature.sql            ← New migration
003_another_feature.sql            ← Another migration
```

**Rule:** Never modify `001_create_complete_schema.sql` after deployment. Always create new migrations for changes.

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the verification queries above
2. Review the migration log output
3. Compare with the expected schema in `README.md`
4. Check PostgreSQL logs: `docker logs postgresql-container`
