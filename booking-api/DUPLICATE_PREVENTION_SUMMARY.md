# ‚úÖ Duplicate Booking Prevention - IMPLEMENTED!

## What Was Added

**Feature:** Prevent duplicate bookings - seats that are already CONFIRMED cannot be booked again.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Repository Method
**File:** `internal/booking/repository.go`

Added `CheckSeatsAvailability()` method:
```go
func CheckSeatsAvailability(ctx, tx, eventID, showtime, seatIDs) ([]string, error)
```

**Returns:** List of already-booked seats (empty list = all available)

**Query Logic:**
- Checks `booking_seats` joined with `bookings`
- Only checks `CONFIRMED` status (not `CANCELLED`)
- Matches exact event ID and showtime
- Runs within transaction for consistency

### 2. Updated Booking Service
**File:** `internal/booking/booking_service.go`

Added seat availability check **before** creating booking:
```go
// Check if seats are available
bookedSeats, err := repository.CheckSeatsAvailability(ctx, tx, eventID, showtime, seatIDs)
if len(bookedSeats) > 0 {
    return fmt.Errorf("seats already booked: %v", bookedSeats)
}
```

### 3. Updated Mock Repository
**File:** `internal/booking/noop_mocks.go`

Added mock method for testing:
```go
func (r *noOpRepository) CheckSeatsAvailability(...) ([]string, error) {
    return []string{}, nil // All seats available
}
```

### 4. Integration Tests
**File:** `internal/booking/duplicate_prevention_test.go` (NEW)

Comprehensive test suite:
- ‚úÖ No booked seats - all available
- ‚úÖ Some seats already booked
- ‚úÖ All requested seats booked
- ‚úÖ Cancelled bookings don't block seats
- ‚úÖ Different showtimes don't conflict

## How It Works

### Booking Flow (Updated)
```
1. Acquire Redis Lock
2. Start PostgreSQL Transaction
3. Validate Event Exists
4. Validate Showtime Matches
5. ‚ú® Check Seat Availability (NEW!)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Query database for existing bookings
   ‚îú‚îÄ Check only CONFIRMED bookings
   ‚îî‚îÄ Return list of already-booked seats
6. If seats available:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Create Booking
   ‚îî‚îÄ Commit Transaction
7. If seats taken:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Return Error: "seats already booked: [...]"
   ‚îî‚îÄ Rollback Transaction
```

### SQL Query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT bs.seat_id
FROM booking_seats bs
INNER JOIN bookings b ON bs.booking_id = b.booking_id
WHERE b.event_id = $1
  AND b.showtime = $2
  AND b.status = 'CONFIRMED'
  AND bs.seat_id = ANY($3)
```

## API Behavior

### First Booking (Success)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventId": "1",
    "userId": "user-123",
    "showtime": "2025-07-15T19:00:00",
    "quantity": 2,
    "seatIds": ["A1", "A2"]
  }'
```

**Response:** `200 OK` ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking created successfully"
}
```

### Duplicate Booking Attempt (Fails)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventId": "1",
    "userId": "user-456",
    "showtime": "2025-07-15T19:00:00",
    "quantity": 2,
    "seatIds": ["A1", "A2"]
  }'
```

**Response:** `400 Bad Request` ‚ùå
```json
{
  "error": "seats already booked: [A1 A2]"
}
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### ‚úÖ Cancelled Bookings
- Status = `CANCELLED` ‚Üí Seats become available again
- Only `CONFIRMED` bookings block seats

### ‚úÖ Different Showtimes
- Same seats at different times = OK
- Each showtime has independent seat availability

### ‚úÖ Different Events
- Same seat IDs in different events = OK
- Seat availability is per event

### ‚úÖ Partial Conflicts
- If ANY seat is taken ‚Üí Entire booking fails
- All-or-nothing booking policy

### ‚úÖ Race Conditions
- Redis lock prevents concurrent bookings
- Transaction ensures atomicity
- Check happens within transaction

## Testing

### Build & Tests
```bash
make build  # ‚úÖ Success
make test   # ‚úÖ All tests pass
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Requires PostgreSQL running
go test -v ./internal/booking/duplicate_prevention_test.go
```

### Manual Testing
See `DUPLICATE_BOOKING_PREVENTION.md` for complete test scenarios.

## Performance

- **Query Time:** Fast (uses existing indexes)
- **Additional Overhead:** One SELECT query per booking
- **Transaction Impact:** Minimal (within existing transaction)
- **Indexes Used:**
  - `idx_bookings_event_id`
  - `idx_booking_seats_booking_id`

## Security

- ‚úÖ SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- ‚úÖ Race condition prevention (lock + transaction)
- ‚úÖ ACID guarantees (transaction isolation)

## Documentation

1. **DUPLICATE_BOOKING_PREVENTION.md** - Complete feature guide
2. **STATUS.md** - Updated with new feature
3. **duplicate_prevention_test.go** - Test examples

## Summary

### Before
- ‚ùå Seats could be double-booked
- ‚ùå No availability checking
- ‚ùå Race conditions possible

### After
- ‚úÖ Seats cannot be double-booked
- ‚úÖ Availability checked within transaction
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages
- ‚úÖ Race condition safe
- ‚úÖ Cancelled bookings release seats
- ‚úÖ All tests passing

## Quick Verification

1. **Start services:**
   ```bash
   # PostgreSQL, Redis, Event-API, Booking-API
   make run
   ```

2. **Create booking:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/bookings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"eventId":"1","userId":"user-1","showtime":"2025-07-15T19:00:00","quantity":2,"seatIds":["A1","A2"]}'
   ```
   **Result:** Success ‚úÖ

3. **Try duplicate:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/bookings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"eventId":"1","userId":"user-2","showtime":"2025-07-15T19:00:00","quantity":2,"seatIds":["A1","A2"]}'
   ```
   **Result:** Error - "seats already booked: [A1 A2]" ‚ùå

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `internal/booking/repository.go` - Added CheckSeatsAvailability
- ‚úÖ `internal/booking/booking_service.go` - Added availability check
- ‚úÖ `internal/booking/noop_mocks.go` - Added mock method

**Duplicate booking prevention is now fully implemented and tested! üéâ**

Seats that are CONFIRMED cannot be booked again for the same event and showtime.
